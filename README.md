# AI in C

An ongoing project to implement [deep learning algorithms](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) in the C programming language.

For more cool projects, please check out [my website](https://trevphil.com/projects).

**Motivation**

What better way to understand deep learning and machine learning algorithms than to implement them in code? That's what this is for.

**Why C?**

Because it's fast. Because it can be difficult for many programmers, which makes it an even more valuable skill to practice.

## Dependencies
